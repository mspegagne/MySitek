Welcome to PayPlug e-commerce library's documentation!
======================================================

This is the documentation of PayPlug's e-commerce library. It is designed to
help developers to use PayPlug as payment solution in a simple, yet robust way.

Prerequisites
=============

PayPlug's library relies on **cURL** to perform HTTP requests and requires **OpenSSL** to secure transactions. You also need **PHP 5.2** or newer.

Installation
============

**Option 1)** clone the repository :
::

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/payplug/payplug_php

**Option 2)** download as a tarball :

- Download the most recent tarball from the `download page`__
- Unpack the tarball
- Put the files somewhere in your project

__ https://bitbucket.org/payplug/payplug_php/downloads#tag-downloads

To get started, add the following to your PHP script :

.. sourcecode :: php

    <?php
    require_once("/path/to/payplug_php/lib/Payplug.php");

Usage
=====

Here's how simple it is to create a payment request :

.. sourcecode :: php

    <?php
    // Loads your account's parameters that you've previously downloaded and saved
    Payplug::setConfig(Parameters::loadFromFile("path/to/file"));

    // Creating a payment request of â‚¬9.99. The payment confirmation (IPN) will be sent to "http://www.example.org/callbackURL"
    $paymentRequest = new PaymentUrl(999, "EUR", "http://www.example.org/callbackURL");

    $paymentUrl = $paymentRequest->generateUrl();

    // Redirects the user to the payment page
    header("Location: $paymentUrl");
    exit();
